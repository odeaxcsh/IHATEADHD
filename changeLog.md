## Planned Updates

- [x] Align callout transform with spec by emitting Paragraph titles and preserving positions.
- [x] Restructure nested heading sections to use Paragraph titles and tighten position handling.
- [x] Ensure selector traversal sees special node-list fields (e.g., `title`) when walking and building parent maps.
- [x] Refresh mount policy options to include `after-heading` and update renderer helpers/tests accordingly.
